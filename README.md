# E-Commerce Recommender System (Online Retail recommendaer)

## Project Overview
This project develops a recommendation system using the Online Retail Dataset (UK-based transactions from 2010–2011).  
The aim is to recommend products to customers based on purchase history and product popularity.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)  
- **Description**: Contains all transactions between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based non-store online retail company.  
- **Size**: Approximately 500,000 transactions, primarily unique all-occasion gift items.  

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior.  
- Build collaborative filtering and content-based recommender systems.  
- Develop a hybrid recommendation system with fallback strategies.  
- Deploy a Streamlit application where users can enter a Customer ID and receive product recommendations.  

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Surprise, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Streamlit (for application deployment)  
- GitHub (for version control and project tracking)  

## Roadmap
1. Setup and Data Collection  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing  
3. Baseline Models (Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based)  
4. Hybrid Recommender and Evaluation  
5. Streamlit Application Deployment  
6. Documentation and Showcase
